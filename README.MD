# The app
This is a simple, one screen, weather app made for kaiOS devices, specifically the Nokia 8110. It uses [wttr.in](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in) as its backend and can be found in the [banana hackers webstore](https://store.bananahackers.net/).

## Versions
There are 2 versions of the app. The geolocation version which uses the devices gps as well as wifi scanning to determine it's location before fetching the weather data, this is usefull for vpn users and occasionaly MAY give higher accuracy. The master version uses your public IP to determine your phones location, this is outsourced to [wttr.in](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in). This version of the app will run faster and is therefore reccomended.

## Install
The recommended method is using [the bhackers store](https://store.bananahackers.net/). However, binaries are also distributed here.

The app is distributed in OmniSD/Gerda package format. Just download the latest release and install with OmniSD

# Usage
The app will automatically give you weather information about the location closest to you, you can also enter any city and the app will fetch the data for that city (or one close to it). The app gives you forecasts for 3 days ahead and the data is stored on your device, meaning you can always check the weather after fetching it without needing an active internet connection.
