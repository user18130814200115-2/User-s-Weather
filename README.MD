# The app
This is a simple, one screen, weather app made for kaiOS devices, specifically the Nokia 8110. It uses [wttr.in](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in) as its backend and can be found in the [banana hackers webstore](https://store.bananahackers.net/).

# Usage
Download the app from the banana hackers store or from the releases and side lad the app using omniSD, Gerda file manager or Wallace toolbox. Alternatively, extract the zip files and sideload using webIDE.
The app will automatically give you weather information about the location closest to you, you can also enter any city and the app will fetch the data for that city (or one close to it). The app gives you forecasts for 3 days ahead and the data is stored on your device, meaning you can always check the weather after fetching it without needing an active internet connection.
